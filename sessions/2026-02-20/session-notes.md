## 重点错题记录 (Error Log for Targeted Practice)

| 涉及知识点 | 原始错误句子 | 纠正后的正确表达 | 错误类型 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Get被动+完成时 | has not got given to anyone | hasn't been assigned to anyone | 完成时不用get被动 |
| 完成时+过去时间 | have been assigned last week | were assigned / got assigned last week | last week 不兼容完成时 |
| would have done | would not missed | would not have missed | Type 3 主句缺 have |
| no vs not | Having no enough resources | Not having enough / Having no resources | no+enough 不兼容 |
| 冠词(可数名词) | put in leave request | put in a leave request | 可数名词需加 a |
| 冠词(序数) | for next release | for the next release | the next + 名词 |

## 识别出的知识差距

| 主题 | 严重程度 | 备注 |
| :--- | :------- | :--- |
| Get被动+完成时规则 | 高 | 现在完成时必须用 has been done, 不用 has got done — 一次纠正后已掌握 |
| 完成时+过去时间不兼容 | 高 | last week/yesterday 等明确过去时间不能用现在完成时 — 已纠正 |
| no vs not 搭配 | 中 | no+名词, not+enough+名词, 不能混搭 |
| 冠词(可数名词/序数) | 中 | a leave request; the next release — 持续关注 |
| 修饰词漏译(顺序词) | 中 | "先/直接/最终" 等顺序/程度词需纳入翻译前扫描 |
| Type 3 主句 have 遗漏 | 中 | would have done 中的 have 不可省 — 已纠正 |

## 今日掌握的主题

| 主题 | 信心程度 | 备注 |
| :--- | :------- | :--- |
| talking to the business | 极高 | 否定/疑问/虚拟全覆盖 |
| put in (提交) | 高 | 搭配多种申请类型 |
| Having + n. (分词状语) | 极高 | 🏆今日最佳语言点, 跨语言点复用 |
| get + 过去分词 (Get被动) | 高 | 完成时规则一次纠正后掌握 |
| get put into (被纳入) | 极高 | 课文核心结构, 代词省略出色 |
| Mixed Conditional | 极高 | 连续 2 道满分, 过去原因→现在结果判断精准 |

## 涵盖的关键概念

-   **Get型被动 vs Be型被动**: 口语用 get done, 正式用 be done; 完成时只用 be done
-   **现在完成时 + 过去时间不兼容**: last week/yesterday → 必须用简单过去时
-   **no vs not**: no + 名词 / not + enough + 名词, 不可叠用
-   **Having + n. 分词状语**: 先摆事实, 再给结论/评价, 职场口语高频
-   **Mixed vs Type 3**: 看结果是现在(would do)还是过去(would have done)
-   **early vs earlier**: 比较语义时用 earlier (相对于实际时间点)

## 下次会话的行动项

-   **复习**: Get被动+完成时规则 (has been done, NOT has got done)
-   **复习**: 冠词(可数名词 a/an; 序数 the next/the last)
-   **复习**: 修饰词扫描 — 增加"先/再/就/才"等顺序词
-   **练习**: 检查 24BEC-10s 是否还有其他值得训练的语言点
-   **探索**: 进入下一篇课文

## 备注

- 学生跨语言点复用能力突出(in charge of + talking to; put in 嵌入 Having 句式)
- Mixed Conditional 判断已趋于稳定, 连续多天满分
- 冠词问题仍需持续关注(可数名词/序数词前加 the)
- 修饰词漏译问题从时间/程度词扩展到顺序词(先/直接)
- Get被动的完成时限制为新发现规则, 学生一次纠正后即掌握, 学习效率极高
