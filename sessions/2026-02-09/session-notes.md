## Knowledge Gaps & Corrections
- **Mixed Conditionals**: Student initially struggled with the 'past cause -> present result' structure but corrected it through practice.
- **Transitive Verbs**: Improved on skipping unnecessary prepositions (e.g., mention, schedule).
- **Virtual Past**: Corrected `had did` to `had done`.
- **Prepositions**: Reinforced `be in` vs `be in the office` and `problem with`.

## Performance Evaluation
The student demonstrated high energy and efficiency, often providing multiple correct sentences at once. The transition between technical scenarios (API, bugs, logs) and business English was seamless.

## Next Steps
- Start **09BEC** text analysis.
- Quick fire review of `had done` vs `had did` in past perfect virtual contexts.
